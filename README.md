Hello!

I am a med student looking to learn how to program, because it's a subject I have always found interesting and have always wanted to get into. As a classic INTP, Enneagram type 5 person, I want to be able to learn as much as I can at my own pace. Hoping this journey will lead somewhere fruitful, but regardless, I think a little more knowledge doesn't hurt :)
